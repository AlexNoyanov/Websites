    Annie has been a member of the family for three years. Children are much easier to raise.
    They don't don't think with their noses and their stomachs. And they don't get depressed
    when you tell them to quit licking their rear-ends. Annie also is known as &quot;The Hound
    from Hell.&quot; She has been the topic of several columns.</p>

    <p><font size="5"><strong>I</strong></font><font size="3">t all started because my partner
    in life put a grocery list on the refrigerator door.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The list is posted every week on the refrigerator. It&#146;s there so if
    a family member thinks of something we need, she or he (me being the only he) can write it
    down.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">One Friday there was a new item on the list:</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">&quot;Beagle&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">When my mate asked if I had anything to do with the beagle order I
    assured her I was innocent. I have occasionally requested cauliflower or brussel sprouts
    or sardines, but never a beagle.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Our eldest daughter eventually admitted responsibility. She noted that
    she has always considered the beagle a fascinating animal and had decided to put one on
    the list to see what would happen.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Over the years, several dogs have passed through our lives. The first
    was a border collie who we raised from a pup. She was with us 13 years. No dog who
    followed her ever seemed to measure up. With the exception of the first, all the other
    dogs were grown by the time we got them and had previously acquired idiosyncrasies.
    Because of those problems I had vowed to stick with cats as pets.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The beagle became a regular entry on the grocery list. And we regularly
    ignored it.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">One night my better half observed that there were beagle puppies
    advertised in the newspaper. I tried to ignore her. But the next day, I dropped by the
    place with the pups. Later, the two of us went back for a closer look.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">That night, when our eldest got home from work, Annie, an eight-week-old
    beagle puppy, was sleeping on her bed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The morning after we brought the pup home, I stopped by the home of a
    friend for coffee. I announced that we now have a beagle.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">&quot;We know a guy who used to have a beagle,&quot; my friend said.
    &quot;I was always surprised the dog lived as long as he did. Beagles march to a different
    drummer.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">On Monday I sought advice from the newsroom expert on dogs.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">&quot;Beagles like to dig, you know,&quot; he said.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">I inquired as to the best way to break them of that habit.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">&quot;Some say the best way is when they dig a hole, bury &#145;em in
    it.&quot; he advised.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">A couple of nights later I found a dog book containing a beagle profile</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">&quot;Beagles are cheerful and friendly, but with a tendency to
    willfulness..&quot; said the book. &quot;They cannot be left alone for too long.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Despite the ominous warnings, Annie the Beagle is the main attraction at
    our house. Her mood can be gauged by her little, pointed tail. If the tail is pointing at
    the ground, Annie is sad. If it is straight up she is happy. And the faster it wags, the
    greater the degree of her happiness.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The one family member who isn&#146;t impressed with the new arrival is
    KC the Cat. She is pressed into service as a companion for Annie the beagle when everyone
    else is gone. The pup seems to enjoy the company. KC, however, has expressed to us her
    belief that puppysitting is a job below the dignity of any cat with an ounce of
    self-respect. I gave her my solemn promise to keep her duties a secret from the general
    public. That seemed to make her feel better.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Fortunately K.C. the Cat has never learned to read.</font></p>

    <p><font size="5"><strong>D</strong></font><font size="3">og books and magazines always
    are packed with pictures of every imaginable variety of canine. I have noticed, however,
    that one breed is underrepresented. You don&#146;t see many photos of beagles in those
    publications.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">There&#146;s a reason.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Annie the Beagle recently celebrated her first anniversary as a member
    of our household. Her presence has been an educational experience. We&#146;ve learned
    there are certain things a beagle owner must accept as a part of life.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">If you look up the definition of the word persistence in the dictionary,
    I&#146;m sure you will see an editor&#146;s note advising: &quot;see beagle.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">All of our previous dogs like to roughhouse. But all of them had their
    limits. After a certain amount of chasing the stick or the ball or wrestling, your average
    dog either gets tired of just plain loses interest.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">But beagles never quit.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">If you throw a stick across the yard, Annie the Beagle will chase it
    down, pounce on it and bring it back. If you throw it again she will bring it back again,
    and again and again. She has never voluntarily quit. You must either hide the stick or
    throw it as far as possible and then run inside before she can return.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Beagles look like small dogs. A 40-lb. bar of lead is small, too. But
    that doesn&#146;t make it any easier to pick up. And a bar of lead doesn&#146;t twitch,
    squirm, grunt and try to lick your face with a 15-inch-long tongue.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">When you combine a beagle&#146;s size-to-weight ratio with its
    persistence, you have an animal that can be very tiring. If you wrestle with Annie the
    Beagle and try to fend off her charges, she uses her front paws and the weight behind them
    to push your arms out of the way. If you successfully defend yourself and push her away,
    she bounces back to the attack like a steel spring. And no matter how many time you push
    her away, she keeps coming back for more.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Now one might think that the above qualities, plus their extraordinary
    sense of smell, would make beagles excellent candidates for police work. But they have a
    fatal flaw in their character. They will give up the hottest scent or the most savage
    attack for the proper incentive..</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">All the fugitive would have to say is, &quot;Hey. Would you like a
    weenie?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Annie the Beagle is one of the world&#146;s great eating machines. She
    will eat dog food, cat food, cooked meat, raw meat, popcorn, carrots, green beans,
    broccoli, pretzels and peppers. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Actually, Annie doesn&#146;t eat anything. She simply inhales anything
    chewable, burps and wants more. If Mother Nature gave beagles taste buds, the effort was
    wasted. They never keep anything in their mouths long enough to savor the flavor.
    That&#146;s fortunate considering some of the other stuff they eat that I haven&#146;t
    listed because of reader sensitivities. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Some readers may think that my assessment of beagles is just a case of
    poor parenting -- that all the problems could be solved with some strict discipline. But
    those folks have never seen the changes that occur when the beagle owner attempts to be
    strict.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">At the first utterance of the words &quot;bad dog!&quot; Annie the
    Beagle&#146;s head and tail droop until they almost touch the ground. She staggers
    heart-broken to her bed next to the fireplace and falls into it. She hangs her head out of
    the bed and looks at you with an &quot;I don&#146;t deserve to live.&quot; expression.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">No animal can match a beagle when it comes to being sad. And when Annie
    throws in a soft groan and a sigh, any sensitive, caring human would do exactly what we do
    -- offer her a weenie.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Which also goes a long way toward explaining her weight.</font></p>

    <p><font size="5"><strong>A</strong></font>nnie the Beagle is rewriting the dictionary.</p>
    <p>Since she joined the family two years ago, Annie's favorite spot in our house has been
    her doggie bed in front of the fireplace hearth in the family room. Her abode is sometimes
    referred to as &quot;the Beagle's Nest,&quot; On other occasions it is known as &quot;The
    Den of the Filthy Beast.&quot; The Filthy Beast title came into being one day when this
    writer was watching an old Cary Grant Movie called <i>Father Goose</i>. Given some of the
    habits of our pet, the term seemed appropriate.</p>
    <p>From the Beagle's Nest, the Filthy Beast surveys her domain, constantly looking and
    listening.</p>
    <p>The dog's primary focus is the refrigerator, located on the far side of a counter that
    separates the kitchen from the family room. If she sees the refrigerator door open, she
    leaps from her bed and races to that location. She stands in front of the open
    refrigerator, wistfully gazing at its contents -- much like small boys of the 1950s
    devoured the pages of the toy section of the Montgomery Ward catalog as Christmas
    approached.</p>
    <p>The Filthy Beast's movements usually are restricted to two rooms by a folding wooden
    &quot;child proof&quot; gate that can be closed to keep her out of the rear portion of the
    house. That area is recognized as the domain of our two cats.</p>
    <p>Annie often acts like her hearing isn&#146;t one of her strong points. If she jumps up
    on the couch she can&#146;t hear a human yelling at her from a distance of five feet. But
    she has a selective impairment.</p>
    <p>Although Annie can't see the entrance to Cat Land from her nest, she can tell the
    difference between someone just pulling the gate across the doorway, and actually hooking
    it, even when she&#146;s asleep.</p>
    <p>If the dog doesn't hear the faint scraping sound made by the gate hook sliding into the
    catch, she immediately shifts to wide awake mode. As soon as the human who improperly
    closed the gate leaves the scene, Annie tip toes to the barrier, noses it open, and makes
    a run for the cat food dish.</p>
    <p>It takes the Filthy Beast about two seconds to inhale all the cat food. She does it
    quickly because she knows that the moment we discover what she is doing, we will yell
    &quot;Bad Dog!&quot; drag her to the back door and boot her out in the yard.
    Unfortunately, Annie's love of cat food is much greater than her fear of punishment.</p>
    <p>A some point in the past, someone coined the term &quot;wolf&quot; to describe people
    or animals who eat their food as quickly as possible. Because wolves run in packs, eating
    is a highly competitive business. The wolf that doesn&#146;t wolf its food goes hungry.</p>
    <p>I have seen films of packs of wolves wolfing their food. I have also seen Annie the
    Beagle eat. Beagles are pack animals, too. Based on my observations, I firmly believe that
    a much more accurate term for gluttony should be based on the latter animal rather than
    the former.</p>
    <p>Besides, &quot;Beagling&quot; a meal has a nicer ring to it that &quot;wolfing.&quot;</p>

    <p><font size="4"><strong><a name="Beagles">Beagles</a> need less nose, more brains</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="5"><strong>M</strong></font><font size="3">other Nature gave the beagle one
    of the most sensitive noses in the canine world. But I&#146;m suspicious the dog paid a
    high price for its keen sense of smell. </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Annie the Beagle is primarily a house dog. She spends much of the day
    asleep in her doggie bed in the family room, in front of the fireplace. She needs as much
    rest as possible because of what happens every time she steps into the back yard.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">If the beagles of the world had an official motto, it would be read
    &quot;Born to smell.&quot; A beagle&#146;s nose is its life. Whenever Annie goes outside,
    she believes she has an inherited obligation to determine who or what has been in the area
    since her previous patrol.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Annie&#146;s first chore is to take a fast lap to clear the yard of
    freeloading robins who are harvesting worms and insects from the grass. The birds scatter
    to nearby trees or the top of the back fence, screaming obscenities at their tormentor.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">With the robin patrol completed, Annie gets down to some serious
    smelling.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Most dogs concentrate on one particular scent. Annie, however, uses the
    shotgun approach. She races back and forth across the grass, nose to the ground. Despite
    careful study, this writer has been unable to identify any logical pattern to the
    dog&#146;s search technique. Her head whips from side-to-side like a high-pressure hose
    that has slipped from the grasp of a fireman.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">When Annie is in full sniff, her nose makes a sound like a Huey
    helicopter approaching a hot landing zone during the Vietnam War </font><font size="3"
    face="Symbol">-</font><font size="3"> a low frequency thump that can be heard all over the
    neighborhood.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">What makes Annie&#146;s search technique interesting is that at the same
    time she is thumping, which involves inhaling, she also is snorting, which requires her to
    exhale. The periodic snorting is necessary to expel grass, twigs, small insects and other
    assorted debris she accidentally sucks into her nose during the thumping process.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Thumping and snorting at the same time is a pretty remarkable fete by
    any standard. But Annie takes smelling to a whole new level. For every 10 thumps and two
    snorts, she throws in an excited yelp, just to let us know she&#146;s hot on the trail of
    something.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">We&#146;ve come to accept Annie&#146;s antics. But it&#146;s
    embarrassing when someone from the neighborhood passes our residence during an evening
    stroll and spots our little brown, black and white Dervish whirling, thumping, snorting
    and yelping around the backyard, floppy ears flying. It would be even more embarrassing if
    the passersby knew that much of the time Annie is following her own scent. In other words,
    she&#146;s in hot pursuit of herself.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">It often requires thirty minutes or more for Annie to make a thorough
    sweep of the yard. But returning to the house creates another problem. In the dog&#146;s
    absence, humans have walked on the floors, and sat in chairs. The two resident cats have
    made their regular rounds. And all those new trails have to be fully traced and cataloged.
    That means more sniffing. And if a stranger has been in the house in Annie&#146;s absence,
    we get the full whirling, thumping, snorting and yelping routine again.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">When she finally completes her interior security check, it&#146;s back
    to her bed to rest up for the next patrol.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Sometimes I find myself wishing Mother Nature would have given beagles a
    little less nose and a few more brains.</font></p>

    <p><font size="5"><strong>D</strong></font><font size="3">uke the Dog was a member of our
    household for about a year. Duke, who appeared to be part collie and part wolf, was
    eventually given to a nice lady who lived on a farm where he had more room to roam and dig
    holes..</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">We were driving past Duke&#146;s home recently when my partner in life
    observed that the change was a good one because the dog was too big and too smart for us
    to handle. I agreed, noting that&#146;s what makes Annie the Beagle, the perfect dog for
    our family.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">One of the reasons we adopted a beagle was that they aren&#146;t very
    big But dimensions can be misleading. The only thing denser than a beagle&#146;s body is a
    lead ingot of similar size. The advantage of lead is that it doesn&#146;t squirm around
    and try to lick your face with a 15-inch tongue.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">But a beagle&#146;s body isn&#146;t the only thing that&#146;s dense.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Most dogs will fall for a trick a few times before getting wise. A
    beagle just keeps falling and falling and falling...</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Take the case of &quot;Oh my gosh!&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Our family room features a large picture window. The sill is only a
    couple of feet above the floor. This means Annie the Beagle can put her front feet on the
    sill and watch the world go by outside.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Annie takes it personally when someone walks past on the street outside.
    That situation is cause for considerable baying, bellowing and yipping as she watches them
    from her lookout.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Annie has better things to do, however, than stand in the window all day
    -- mainly sleep. Therefore, she depends on the other members of the household to keep her
    informed on what&#146;s going on outside.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The trigger phrase is &quot;Oh, my gosh!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The dog can be anywhere in the house, asleep or awake. But if someone
    utters the above three words, Annie lets out a bellow and makes a dash for the family room
    window.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Our guardian always takes the most direct route to the window. If you
    happen to be dozing in an easy chair that is between the dog and the window, you run the
    serious risk of being trampled and deafened.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">If Annie gets to her observation post and discovers there really is
    somebody there, she shrieks for someone to open the back door as she races to that exit.
    Once outside, she shouts dog obscenities through the chain link fence until the passersby
    are out of sight.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Nineteen times out of 20, however, there is nobody outside the window.
    The &quot;Oh my gosh!&quot; usually is uttered by one of our daughters just to liven the
    place up.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The amazing thing is that no matter how many bogus alarms are issued,
    Annie never loses her enthusiasm. As I write this I have just finished yelling &quot;Oh my
    gosh!&quot; The dog is still up in the window, staring intently down the street. And if I
    say it again five minutes from now, she&#146;ll be right back in the window.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">It doesn&#146;t take much to entertain Annie the Beagle. Obviously, it
    doesn&#146;t take much to entertain her human associates either.</font></p>

    <p><font size="5"><strong>A</strong></font>nnie the Beagle, our Dog in Residence, has
    attained some notoriety in the neighborhood and the area since she joined us three years
    ago. Because I have written several columns about the trials and tribulations of being a
    beagle owner, people sometimes stop me on the street to ask about Annie&#146;s health and
    mine.</p>
    <p>But recently, our pooch&#146;s fame spread over a much wider area. We now sometimes
    refer to her as Annie the Electronic Beagle.</p>
    <p>It all started one evening when I was &quot;surfing the net&quot; &#150; browsing the
    Internet using my computer. During the course of my investigation, I bumped into a site
    titled, &quot;Beagles on the Web,&quot; It includes an entire page of links to the home
    pages of beagle owners in the United States and Canada. Click on the name of a dog, and
    you usually get pictures and a description of that animal &#150; &quot;Here&#146;s Barney
    as a puppy peering out of the sleeve of my husband&#146;s shirt. Here&#146;s Barney at six
    months eating my husband&#146;s shirt, etc. Some pages even include sound clips of beagles
    baying, barking or sniffing.</p>
    <p>After looking over Beagles on the Web page, I decided I could contribute. I rounded up
    several columns I have written on Life with Annie and put them together on apage on my web
    site (http://www.netnow.micron.net/~wcornell). I titled the collection, <i>The Beagle
    Chronicles</i>. Then I E-mailed Beagles on the Web and asked them to add Annie to their
    links.</p>
    <p>Things move fast in cyberspace. Within days, I started getting E-mail from web surfers.</p>
    <p>A couple in Chapin, S.C. said the <i>Beagle Chronicles</i> is a regular stop for them.
    They told me about their 15-year-old beagles, Ranger and Runner. That suggests we may have
    to put up with Annie 12 more years.</p>
    <p>A woman affiliated with the University of Kansas said she&#146;s convinced her beagle,
    Dizzy, is part cat because he spends all day looking out the window or sleeping. (Beagles
    are great sleepers).</p>
    <p>I even got a message from a guy in Lancaster, Va. who saw the <i>Beagle Chronicles</i>
    and wants to immortalize Annie by painting her picture on a pillow (for a price).</p>
    <p>But the best letter came from St. John&#146;s Newfoundland.</p>
    <p>&quot;I got a beagle in September and my life has not been normal ever since,&quot;
    wrote Melanie Watkins. &quot;I sometimes wondered if our beagle was a little unusual. I am
    relieved to know he isn&#146;t the only one like it.&quot;</p>
    <p>Recently I learned <i>The Beagle Chronicles</i> was named the &quot;Sniff of the
    week&quot; on the Beagles on the Web page.</p>
    <p>I&#146;m guessing there are similar Internet sites for collies, German shepherds,
    Dobermans and most other dogs. But judging from the responses I have received to the <i>Beagle
    Chronicles</i>, I believe owners of that breed view the Internet connection differently --
    as a support group. It gives me a warm feeling to know my columns about Annie are helping
    some of those folks realize their pets aren&#146;t retarded &#150; they are just beagles.</p>
    <p>Annie&#146;s new fame hasn&#146;t affected her in the least. She still leaps from her
    bed and races to the window to scream obscenities at passing joggers and neighborhood
    canines. She continues to scheme to steal the cats&#146; food. And she still spends hours
    tracking herself around the backyard. If she ever catches herself I&#146;ll have a great
    column.</p>
